				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>I started my career in journalism. As newspapers began focusing more and more on digital products, my interest in technology grew. Most recently, I served as Digital Content Editor for a business publication. I decided to officially make a career switch and attend The Iron Yard Academy in summer 2013, an intensive, 13-week coding school. There, I learned the ins and outs of front-end engineering. I'm currently looking for an exciting opportunity to continue developing my skills. I'm willing to relocate for the right position.</p>
